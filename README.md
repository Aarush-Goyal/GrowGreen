`Grow Green` that allows contributors worldwide to create awareness about environment and do their bit by contributing.

## About GrowGreen

‚úÖWe will make an Eco website or Web App(preferred) that can find nearest nursery, plant shop, organic shop etc like everything related to planting and agriculture, small scale or big scale.

‚úÖIt will have a panel of Blogs and posts for these topics.People can post their efforts towards Environment. 

‚úÖWe will include personal reminders(alarm) for contributing towards Environment. For example, daily reminders to water the plants or monthly reminders to sow seeds.etc

‚úÖI've seen there is no website or app as such.which have all the features. 

‚úÖTo this we can also add giving virtual rewards like coins, from which they can buy plants or help plant one ( anything similar). Rewards to those who post any contribution with a selfie increasing the community bonding for the love of environment.

‚úÖ(Future scope for this website) 
After this we can also include a panel for soil testing and all.. that can include ML/Data Mining.
