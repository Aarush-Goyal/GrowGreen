# About GrowGreen

# Description
✅We will make an Eco website or Web App(preferred) that can find nearest nursery, plant shop, organic shop etc like everything related to planting and agriculture, small scale or big scale.

✅Then it can have a panel of Blogs and posts for these topics...People can post their efforts towards Environment.We will create a feed like feature where they will be able to upload their images along with some captions.

✅We can include personal reminders(alarm) for contributing towards Environment. For example, daily reminders to water the plants or monthly reminders to sow seeds.etc

✅We are trying to accomodate the above features and as many as possible. 

✅To this we can also add giving virtual rewards like coins, from which they can buy plants or help plant one ( anything similar). Rewards to those who post any contribution with a selfie increasing the community bonding for the love of environment.

✅(Future scope for this website) 
After this we can also include a panel for soil testing and all.. that can include ML/Data Mining
